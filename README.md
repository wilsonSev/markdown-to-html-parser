# 📝 Markdown Parser in Java

A lightweight Markdown-to-HTML converter written in Java.  
This project was built for educational purposes to understand how markup parsing works from the ground up — without using any third-party libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- Parses a subset of Markdown (e.g. paragraphs, emphasis, strong, strikeout, etc.)
- Produces valid HTML output
- Custom object-oriented design
- 💡 Includes a fully custom-built **Scanner class** for text analysis

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Compile the project:
```bash
javac md2html/Md2Html.java
```
2. Run the parser:
```bash
java md2html.Md2Html input.md output.html
```
input.md — your Markdown file
output.html — the resulting HTML
